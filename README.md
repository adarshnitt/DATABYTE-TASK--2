Training and Deploying a ML model

Problem Statement: Training and Deploying a ML model with the "Iris dataset".

Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

My Approach:

     1-Function:data_prep isnused to read data and separate target data as y.

     2-Model_knn: uses k neighrest neighbors[KNN]  machine learning theorem to predict ours targeted variable.
       we imported it from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier.

     3-Model_LR : will predict targeted variable by using LogisticRegression classifier[LR].
       we imported LR from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression.
     4- Also i used ensembling with LR via AdaBoostClassifier.
