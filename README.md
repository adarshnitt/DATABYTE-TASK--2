Problem Statement: Training and Deploying a ML model with the "Iris dataset".

Libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

My Approach:
     WE WILL  PREDICT FLOWER TYPE (i.e."virginica"),using LogisticRegression and also with KNeighborsClassifier of Machine Learning Algorithms.

     1-Function:data_prep, is used to read data and separate targeted data as Y(i.e. flower type).

     2-Model_knn: uses k-Nearest neighbors[KNN]  machine learning algorithm to predict our targeted variable(i.e. flower type).
       we imported it from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier.

     3-Model_LR :It will predict targeted variable Y by using LogisticRegression classifier[LR].
       we imported LR from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression.
     4-Also i used ensembling with LR via AdaBoostClassifier.
